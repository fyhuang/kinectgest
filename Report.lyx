Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
With the introduction of the Microsoft Kinect
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 and the subsequent release of open-source drivers for Windows, we have
 seen entirely new avenues of motion sensing techniques open which had previousl
y been prohibitively expensive for individual experimention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first stage -- that of converting raw RGB and depth images into a usable
 representation of the body -- is provided by a motion tracking program.
 Our project takes motion tracking data from this program and tries to produce
 a more holistic representation of the user's semantic intentions.
 We accomplish this through a gesture recognition system where, for a given
 target application, a set of gestures is defined, and the system recognizes
 those gestures when performed by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gestures we have selected to recognize as a demonstration of the system
 are as follows:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

.
 To simplify collection of training data, we recognized only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

right-handed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 gestures -- that is, only punches made with the right hand, kicks made
 with the right foot, etc.
 are recognized when the gesture has a handedness.
 Most of these gestures are self-evident; a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clap
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be multiple or just a single clap, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 is mainly in whether the foot comes to chest level or not.
 Samples of some of these gestures can be found in figure TODO.

\begin_layout Standard
We will begin by introducing some terms to be used in the rest of this report.
 A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

frame
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a single time slice.
 Each frame contains the locations and joint angles of all 20 joints.
 See figure TODO for a schematic representation of the joint locations.
 Each joint is represented as a 3-dimensional point; in addition, each joint
 has a parent joint, which is intuitively defined.
 (For a precise listing, see JointState.cs:43.) Using this, we define a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

joint angle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be the angle between the two vectors: 
\begin_inset Formula $Pa(Joint)\rightarrow Joint$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Pa(Pa(Joint))\rightarrow Pa(Joint)$
\end_inset

.
 A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gesture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

input gesture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a non-empty sequence of frames.
 We call the output of the recognition engine a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

result
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Each result encapsulates three possible gesture

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 that the engine thinks are most likely with their confidence scores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Recognizing a gesture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of recognizing a gesture involves several steps.
 First, we train the various models used in the program with an appropriate
 set of training data.
 (Things that one should consider when generating training data are examined
 in section TODO.) There are two trained models: one, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutral stance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model, recognizes whether single frames represent a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutral stance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The second, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

recognizer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, takes input gestures (sequences of frames as defined above) and produces
 a result.
 During real-time operation, the engine receives 30 raw frames per second
 from the motion tracker.
 Raw frames are pre-processed by storing the absolute position of the neck
 joint, and then recomputing the positions of the other joints relative
 to the neck joint (joint angles are also computed at this step).
 This is necessary, as the Kinect is able to track backward- and forward
 motion, and our method needs to be translation-independent.
 The processed frames are sent to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

segmenter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which uses the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutral stance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model to separate the input stream into logical segments.
 Some of these segments are then sent to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

recognizer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as input gestures.
 Results from the recognizer are then printed/acted upon as they are received.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This segmentation-based approach is the core of our ability to recognize
 gestures in real-time.
 By using a simpler method to first separate the continuous input stream
 into discrete segments, heuristically culling those segments, and only
 then running the full recognition model on those segments, we achieve high
 recognition speed while still maintaining good recognition accuracy.
 (See the results section for a more detailed description of our performance
 results.) Needless to say, this is important in real-time applications like
 video games.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutral stance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The neutral stance model represents a stance where the user is idle and
 not in the middle of performing a gesture.
 The neutral stance model is fairly simplistic: we model the mean and variance
 of the normalized positions of all the joints from a customized set of
 parents.
 The selections were made in this model to fit closely with expectations
 about the human body (all the right arm joints, for example, were parented
 to the right shoulder joint), as well as to minimize model error from differing
 body shapes, height, etc.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Model for single gesture recognition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To formalize our model, we introduce the following notations: Let 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 be the overall gesture class node that is hidden and we would like to know
 its value, ranging from 1 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the total number of gesture class labels.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1},\ldots,\ F_{m}$
\end_inset

 be feature nodes that are parents of the input gesture sequence node 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, and further in our most basic model, 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is the parent of all feature nodes.
 The basic graphical model we used is shown in TODO.
 To model the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the class label
 node, which takes on discrete values, given inputs from all feature nodes,
 which produce continuous values, we considered several different approaches
 (see the section on Development and Implementation for the full story).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Logistic regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One approach is that instead of considering the class label node by itself,
 we break it into 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 subnodes, 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{1},\ldots,\ G_{k}$
\end_inset

, and let node 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 be the parent of all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 gesture class subnodes.
 Each subnode 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{i}$
\end_inset

 takes on binary values such that 1 means the input gesture sequence belongs
 to this particular gesture class 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and it is natural to model the relationship between each 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1},\ldots,\ F_{m}$
\end_inset

 as a bernoulli distribution, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(G_{i}\ |\ F_{1},\ldots,\ F_{m})\sim Bernoulli(\theta)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is depended upon the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1}$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 We can also view each 
\begin_inset Formula $P(G_{i}=1\ |\ F_{1},\ldots,\ F_{m})$
\end_inset

 as the confidence score that the given input gesture sequence belongs to
 this particular gesture class 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Then, the overall class label node, which takes on values 1 through 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, is simply a selector variable that selects the gesture class that has
 the highest confidence score for this particular input gesture sequence.
 To determine the CDF of each subnode 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{i}$
\end_inset

, which follows a bernoulli distribution, we naturally use a logistic regression
 during learning.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Softmax regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another approach we considered was to model the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 given feature values 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1},\ldots,\ F_{m}$
\end_inset

 according to a multinomial distribution, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(C\ |\ F_{1},\ldots,\ F_{m})\sim Multinomial(\theta_{1},\ldots,\ \theta_{m})$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1},\ldots,\ \theta_{m}$
\end_inset

 such that their sum is 1.
 After we obtain the specific parameters of this distribution given any
 inputs 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1},\ldots,\ F_{m}$
\end_inset

, we can treat each 
\begin_inset Formula $P(C=k\ |\ F_{1},\ldots,\ F_{m})$
\end_inset

 as a confidence score that this input gesture sequence belongs to a specific
 gesture class 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 The final output of our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

recognizer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is then simply the most probable gesture class under the computed set of
 feature values.
 To determine the CDF of class node 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

, which follows a multinomial distribution discussed above, we naturally
 use a softmax regression during learning.

\begin_layout Section
Development and implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early during development, we decided to implement cross-validation in order
 to take advantage of our small training data size.
 We use a roughly 75%/25% split for cross-validation.
 We first concentrated on the recognizer component (single gesture recognition),
 as we predicted that this part would be the most difficult to get good
 results in.
 The first model we implemented was a naïve Bayes model.
 Since the naïve Bayes model, in its simplest implementation, uses only
 binary features, we started with a small set of binary features.
 These were features, for example, that measured whether the difference
 between the minimum and the maximum values of a component (i.e.
 the X-position of a joint) over the entire input gesture was greater than
 a certain threshold.
 This produced significantly-better-than-random results, but the highest
 we could coax it to go was about 60% accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We quickly realized, however, that binary features were not going to be
 enough to encode the vast amount of variance and sublety present in the
 problem domain.
 At this point, taking inspiration from some comments made during the interactiv
e sessions, we decided to implement a logistic regression model with continuous
 features.
 In both of these models, the features are functions which map an entire
 input gesture to a real number.
 In making the decision between choosing a more temporally-cogniscent model
 and modeling these temporal relationships with features, we chose the latter
 due to the much lower cost of learning and inference over the simpler model,
 in addition to the ability to easily encode certain features as entire-gesture
 functions rather than as graph structures.
 (For example, the difference between the minimum and the maximum of a component
 is significantly more compactly represented as a feature function.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon implementing logistic regression and obtaining some promising results,
 we started to add more features to expand the power of our model.
 Surprisingly, the training data contained enough information to support
 at least 16 different features (which is what we ended up with).
 None of our features were learned with near-zero weight across all gesture
 classes.
 We did, however, begin to encounter non-convergence problems with our logistic
 regression.
 After speaking to Andrew and doing some research, we determined that some
 of our features were causing complete- or quasi-complete separation within
 our dataset.
 On realizing this, we added 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-regularization to the logistic regression, as well as a check for completely-se
parating features.
 Upon the discovery of such a feature, the program warns the user and turns
 the feature off (effectively preventing it from having influence on either
 the training or the recognition process).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, we were fairly satisfied with our results, but wanted to
 see if we could more naturally represent the relationship between the resulting
 gesture class and the feature set than a set of distinct logistic regressions.
 We decided to try a softmax regression with the same feature set.
 However, after running both the logistic regression and the softmax regression
 through a series of cross-validated tests, we found that the logistic regressio
n still produced slightly better results, as well as being easier to work
 with in the code.
 When we were running experiments with the softmax regression, we discovered
 some interesting phenomena.
 Since we had not implemented separation-testing for the softmax code, we
 ran it using several features which were known to completely separate the
 training data.
 As a result, while the regression did not fail to converge, the model was
 completely unable to recognize test inputs, often producing results near
 random.
 We are still not completely certain whether the separation or simply a
 particular quirk of the feature causes this.
 Thus we decided to use the logistic regression as the final recognition
 technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Feature selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We began with a fairly spartan set of features, measuring global (across
 a single input gesture) phenomena, such as (as mentioned) the difference
 between the peaks.
 This worked for fairly large movements, such as the punch and high kick
 gestures.
 We found that the data for the hand joint angle was quite noisy (by which
 we mean oscillating from 0 to 90 degrees at a time), so for the features
 that used joint angles we measured the wrist joint angle instead.
 This gives much less noise, but also means we cannot see the angle of the
 hand.
 The gestures we started having problems with were initially the two flick
 gestures, the wave, and the clap.
 We tried several feature types to account for the large errors in recognizing
 the flicks.
 First, we hypothesized that adding a directionality to the peak measurement
 (whether max or min comes first) would help us to distinguish between the
 left and right flicks.
 Unfortunately, we discovered a particular quirk of the way the training
 data was recorded: in many of the flick left training instances, the TA
 returned his hand beyond the initial point, causing the min and max measurement
s to go to unexpected values (and switch direction).
 Thus we had to use more sophisticated features to capture this difference.
 These and other quirks (the flicks were particularly inconsistent in their
 execution in the training data), along with the relative paucity of training
 instances, made the flicks among the hardest of the gestures to accurately
 identify.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we tried to measure the overall 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

skew
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the gesture from the starting point: more positive or negative (say,
 on the X axis).
 This particular feature, however, caused such bad separation behavior that
 we were unable to actually use it.
 Next we incorporated a conditional measurement (say, to only apply the
 feature in frames where the hand is beyond a certain plane), in order to
 remove the influence of the starting and ending positions from the measurements.
 We also started adding multi-joint features: for example, a feature which
 measures the minimum distance between the hands at any point along the
 input gesture.
 This helped our performance greatly with the flick left gesture (and the
 corresponding maximum distance feature with the flick right), as well as
 the clap gesture (as might be expected).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To capture the jump motion, we had to re-incorporate some absolute position
 data, in this case using the absolute Y-position of the neck joint.
 Differentiating wave from the flicks proved to be a small problem: while
 we intuited that a feature which captured the number of critical points
 would be able to distinguish them (wave would have more critical points),
 implementing such a feature reliably proved to be difficult.
 Since the data is quite noisy, many 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fake
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 critical points appear in the input, especially at regions where the joint
 does not move (i.e.
 the real critical points and the beginning and end of sequences).
 We had originally thought to implement smooting in the raw data converter,
 but decided it was easier to implement some crude smooting in the feature
 instead.
 Despite the inclusion of significants amount of noise in this feature,
 we found that it still had high effectiveness in distinguishing between
 wave and the other gestures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Segmentation algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The segmentation algorithm uses a more fixed heuristic, and learns only
 the neutral stance feature.
 Initially, we had thought about using a more fully-integrated system instead
 of our current, more isolated design.
 We met with Hendrik and discussed several more integrated gesture segmentation
 solutions, such as HMMs over the entire input sequence and dynamic time
 warping.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "from-dtw-to-hmm"

\end_inset

 However, we determined that this method might be too expensive to implement
 for a real-time recognizer (especially one that would be competing for
 CPU time with the motion tracker).
 While we did some basic tests, we did not pursue more advanced optimizations
 such as dynamic programming methods.
 Instead, we decided to use a simpler model for the segmentation phase,
 reasoning that a simple 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

performing gesture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not performing gesture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 distinction would be sufficient to achieve reasonable performance.
 This intuition proved to be somewhat correct: our original implementation
 of this idea was fairly successful.
 (See figure TODO for a screen capture.) Basically, we look for long strings
 of non-neutral-stance frames and call that a gesture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, because no training data was provided for the neutral stance feature
 upon which this method depends, we culled our own set of training data
 from the provided sequences.
 Since the sequences involved only Hendrik, we inadvertently trained the
 model to match his body shape.
 Thus, when we tested the segmenter on a sequence recorded by me, it failed
 to segment even a single sequence.
 In order to improve the generalization performance of the segmenter, we
 tried a number of different approaches to learning the neutral stance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first, we tried to use the joint angles instead of the joint positions,
 reasoning that this would be more independent of body shape.
 While this was true, even with extreme weighting and damping, we were unable
 to effectively combat the noise from the angle measurements.
 We then tried multiple modifications of combining the joint angles and
 positions.
 Our current model calculates modified joint angles using different joint
 parents.
 By using more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

distant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parents, we cut down significantly on sampling noise (for example, in the
 hand joints); and by choosing parents carefully, we can maintain sufficient
 body-shape independence.
 Currently, our model parents all the joints on the limbs to their respective
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connecting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 joints on the main body (i.e.
 right elbow, right wrist, and right palm are parented to the right shoulder).
 This approach segments fairly effectively - we were able to achieve 60-70%
 accuracy (subjectively) on our testing sequences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we noticed that most of the errors in our segmentation occurred
 when the user made gestures too quickly and did not return fully to the
 neutral stance.
 In these cases, our algorithm wouldn't break the gesture in the middle,
 and instead would attempt to recognize the entire sequence as a single
 gesture.
 To deal with this error, we introduced a damping factor to the confidence
 threshold.
 The damping factor increases as the length of the gesture increases.
 That is, as the gesture currently being segmented gets longer, the threshold
 of confidence that is required to call a frame a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutral stance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 gets smaller.
 This change has helped considerably in faster-moving parts of sequences.

We can immediately see the potential for this kind of model.
 Compare to the results that we achieved by using a naïve Bayes model, as
 seen in table TODO.

The segmenter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The segmentation process could be made more accurate with a more temporally-base
d model.
 Instead of using single-frame features (through the neutral stance model),
 a more sophisticated segmenter might combine properties of several consecutive
 frames to make a more accurate prediction about gesture start and end times.
 This would allow the segmenter to generalize to perhaps more applications
 and user types than the fixed heuristic we use.
